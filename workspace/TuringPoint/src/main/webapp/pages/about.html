					About the Turing Point Team <small>It's Nice to Meet You!</small>
				</h1>
				<font size="3"><p>Turing Point is an educational web
						application that provides students and instructors with an
						effective, convenient, and affordable way to take and administer
						classroom polls and quizzes. Turing Point has been developed from
						the ground up, based on feedback from University of Utah
						instructors and students in order to create a set of tools that
						allow for an unparalleled learning experience. The Turing Point
						web application is designed for use on Desktop and Mobile
						platforms so that users can quickly and easily navigate and access
						information effectively no matter which device they are using. Turing Point
						leverages the fact that most students already have a mobile device
						and therefore will not be required to purchase 3rd party polling
						hardware. This ensures it will be more affordable for students than other
						polling solutions. The Turing Point system provides rapid feedback to both
						students and instructors and enables them to review, analyze, and
						explore results in ways current systems do not. This
						promotes an interactive learning environment where students remain
						engaged and Instructors remain informed of their studentâ€™s
						performance.</p></font>

					Tony Niven <small></small>
				</h3>
				<h4><b>Background</b></h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Tony has always enjoyed computing and from an early age, was in the presence of computers regularly.
						Though his interaction with computers now heavily involves the creation of computer software, he has
						incorporated computing technology into some of his other hobbies, noteably writing and art in various forms.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tony is currently employed as a developer for DriverTech LLC where he is responsible for the creation
						and mantinence of embedded device software. In addition to application development he has taken a 
						leading role in the creation of the automated testing frameworks for web and embedded devices in use 
						by the company today.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tony's computer science education and work experience spans a large variety of languages, development
						techniques and purposes. These range from the creation of learning algorithms to the creation of web
						applications like Turing Point, both in team environments and alone.
					</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h4><b>Primary Project Contributions</b></h4>
				<blockquote>
					<p>
						Tony worked to develop the REST api for the server. He also worked to set up the deployment environment for Turing Point and
						served as a group facilitator and coordinator for meetings or presentations. Tony was primarily responsible for
						the creation of the presentation mode system for instructors and the results system used in the application.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additionally, Tony was responsible for the student management system which allows instructors to
						explore the results of their students on an individual level while also providing key information
						to be used in integrating student results into learning management scoring systems.
					</p>
					<p>
						With applied knowledge in information visualization, Tony created the interactive charts used in 
						the application and all results in the system rely on the results services created by this developer. 
						He was responsible for the creation of the tagging system and tag explorer which allow instructors 
						and students alike to visualize results and get a better grasp of class performances on various topics.
