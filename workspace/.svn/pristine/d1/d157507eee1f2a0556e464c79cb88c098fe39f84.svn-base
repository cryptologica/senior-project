					<h2>Lecture Overview</h2>

					<img src="../img/guide/userdoc_manageresults.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 1em;">

					<blockquote>
					<p>
					When an instructor has selected a lecture to view results for, they are first presented with the Lecture Overview. 
					From this perspective a user will be able to see the names of all questions present in a lecture, the participation 
					in each individual question and the overall percentage of correct responses given for a question.
					</p>
					<p>
					This at a glance information helps instructor users quickly identify and focus on areas they want to analyze. 
					When one clicks on a question either on the question list on the right hand side, or the overview, they are brought 
					to the Question Overview.
					</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h3>Question Overview</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p>
					The question overview allows an instructor to visualize results data for a question. When a question has been 
					responded to by at least one student, the perspective will allow instructors to see both a bar graph, representing 
					the number of times a specific response was selected. Hovering with the mouse over one of these columns will provide 
					a tooltip indicating the full text of the selected option in addition to the number of selections for this option 
					</p>
					<img align="left" src="../img/guide/userdoc_resultgraph.png" style="width: 35%; margin: 1em;">
					<p>
					Users will also be presented with a table containing the answers submitted. In questions that the answers are 
					predefined such as multiple choice or multiple answer question types, the answers created by the instructor in the 
					question creator will be shown here. In fill in the blank type questions, either numeric response or word based 
					answers, all answers submitted by students as well as the single correct answer will be shown in the table as well.
					</p>
					
					<img align="right" src="../img/guide/userdoc_resulttable.png" style="width: 35%; margin: 1em;">
					<p>
					Answers which were marked correct at creation time will show with a green indicator arrow and be written in dark 
					green text to allow the user to differentiate correct answers from incorrect ones. In the case of multiple answer 
					questions, all correct options will be highlighted in such a fashion. The same applies to numeric response types; 
					Any answer that is within the error margin given by an instructor will also be marked correct. Note that hovering 
					over any option in the table highlights the corresponding bar in the chart. This allows the user to easily correlate
					 between views.
					</p>
					</blockquote>
					
					<h3>Student Response Overview</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p>
					When exploring question results from the results explorer, Instructors may also select a response by clicking on it,
					either in the table or in the chart.
					</p>
					<img src="../img/guide/userdoc_studentresponses.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 1em;">
					<p>
					Clicking on an option will bring up the Student Response Overview perspective beneath the chart and table perspectives. 
					From the Student Response Overview perspective, instructors can make determinations as to who may have answered 
					questions incorrectly or who may be struggling to understand key concepts based on the responses they give to 
					questions. For student privacy, this perspective is not enabled in the review tab on the manage polls page and is 
					only enabled in the manage results area of the system.
					</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h3>Tagging</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p>
					Beneath the question overview, the tagging interface is visible. With the tagging interface one can apply tags to questions 
					that can be used to add another level of organization to questions, perhaps based on their content and not the lecture they 
					are contained in.
					</p>
					<img src="../img/guide/userdoc_usertags1.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 1em;">
					<p>
					To use the tagging interface a user simply types a tag into the provided user interface and presses the enter key. 
					After the tag is applied to the question it will appear in the well to the right of the tag entry window. Removing a tag is 
					as simple as clicking the X icon in the tag one wishes to remove. 
					</p>
					<img src="../img/guide/userdoc_usertags2.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 1em;">
					<p>
					Tags can be entered as a list but are always one word, if 
					you wish to have multi-word tags you should consider using a hyphen or non space character to differentiate them. Therefore 
					if a user enters the following: “Computer Programming” two resultant tags, both computer, and programming will be generated. 
					It should be noted also that tags will always be created as lower case words even if entered with capital letters initially.
					</p>
					
					</blockquote>

					<h3>Results Exploration</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<p>
					<img align="left" src="../img/guide/userdoc_resultsexplorer.png" style="width: 55%; margin: 1em;">
			        One of the primary features of tagging is the ability to explore tags. To explore tags one simply clicks on the body of the 
			        tag in question. This will bring up the Results Explorer. The results explorer allows users to browse questions by tags rather 
			        than by lecture, allowing users to examine correlations between topics. When one first starts the Results Explorer, one will 
			        notice that the tag they clicked on to open the explorer is the shown in the currently browsing box. On the right hand side, 
			        all questions in the course with a given tag will be displayed along with the lecture in which they are present. To change which 
			        tag one is browsing, one simply need click on the tag in question and the perspective will show questions containing it.
			        </p>
					<p>
					Clicking on a question in the right hand side will result in a Question Overview perspective for the selected question.
					<img align="left" src="../img/guide/userdoc_resultsexploredetail.png" style="width: 55%; margin: 1em;">
					As one would expect, clicking on a column in the chart will display those who selected the option. 
					If one selects the details tab at the top of the overview, they will be shown the tabular form of the response data and 
					will also be capable of clicking any row within it to bring up the same Student Response Overview.
			      	</p>
			      	
					<p>  
					This compressed version of the Question Overview perspective allows the user to have the same powerful exploration capabilities 
					as the full Question Overview perspective but without having to leave the current page. Because this explorer operates based on 
					the user defined tags defined in the tagging interface, the explorer allows instructors to explore correlations and data relation 
					easily and conveniently.
					</p>
					</blockquote>

					<h3>Results Export</h3>
					<blockquote>
					<img align="right" src="../img/guide/userdoc_exportresults.png" style="width: 35%; margin: 1em;">
					<p>
					From time to time an instructor may wish to use results generated by the application in an external learning management or score 
					tracking system. For this purpose, the manage results page provides a results export feature that allows instructors to export a CSV 
					file containing a list of scores for the lecture in question.
					</p>
					
					<p> 
					Results are exported with the student id as the first column for easy import into other systems. Next is the last name and then first 
					name of each student followed by the number of points they earned. Note that this system only exports aggregate scores for the entire 
					lecture and does not score individual questions. Also remember that points are only generated in the scoring system by answers marked 
					as correct during question creation and that the modification of point values in existing questions that have been answered will 
					change the resulting score calculations of subsequent score exports if the student has answered correctly for the question that was 
					change.
					</p>
