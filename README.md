This project was created by me (JT Newsome), Scott Hadley, Tony Niven, and Sean O'Connor. If you would like to use this project **please ask me first** so I can ask my teammates if it's ok with them! Thanks.

We created this software to help fellow students by providing a free and easy alternative to our University's current "clicker system" which requires buying 3rd party hardware and cloud licensing.

My main contributions were the Play/Edit page on the Instructor Portal and the Course Search on the Student Portal.

## Instructor Portal
The instructor has an online web application they can access. From here they can create courses, lectures, manage students, manage results and create/edit polls/quizzes. Courses contain a collection of lectures and lectures contain a set of questions. Each question can be turned on/off for granular control of question availability to students. Questions can be a variety of types such as: multiple choice, check all that apply, numeric or free response. The instructor has the ability to leave feedback on questions to help them review for tests at later dates. He or she can also use our 'manage results' tool to review questions/lectures and their results with their class or individual students at a later time or directly after closing the question(s).

## Student Portal
The student has an online web app they can access using any mobile device with a modern web-browser (laptop, phone, pc, tablet, etc...). The instructor can also access their portal from a mobile device as the entire system utilizes Bootstrap to make the layout responsive and screen independent. Through this portal the student can answer/edit responses to questions that are open and review their responses to closed questions and look at instructor's feedback to questions. They can also search for courses and add courses.
